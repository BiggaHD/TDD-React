## 🧪 TDD-React

## Overview 👀

TDD-React is a collection of apps built for practice purposes only. They are used to demonstrate Test Driven Development (TDD) using React, Redux, and Jest.

## What is TDD ⁇

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process where coding, testing, and design are tightly interwoven and based on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed. The process involves repeatedly testing the software against all test cases, tracking all software development. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later. TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.
